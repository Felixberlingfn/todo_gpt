The privacy policy for the NIH Data Harvester GPT would include the following key points:

Data Usage: The GPT's primary function is to guide users in retrieving and interpreting data from NIH databases. It does not perform API calls but demonstrates how users can do so themselves.
Personal Data: The GPT does not collect, store, or process personal data. Interactions are not stored, and the GPT does not have the capability to remember past interactions.
User Interaction: Users are encouraged not to share personal health information. If such information is shared, the GPT will remind the user of the privacy policy.
Independence of Sessions: Each session is treated independently, ensuring that information from one session is not carried over to another.
Data Sharing: No data from the interactions is shared with third parties.
Medical Advice: The GPT does not provide medical advice but focuses on data retrieval and interpretation.
Limitations: The GPT explains its limitations, emphasizing that it cannot perform actual API calls due to the limitations of the environment.
This summary reflects the privacy-centric approach of the GPT, ensuring users are aware of the privacy practices and limitations regarding personal data.
